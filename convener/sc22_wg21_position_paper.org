* Open Letter to WG21 and SC22

Dear colleagues of WG21 and SC22,

With the decision on the next C++ Convener approaching, I want to share
why I am seeking this role and the vision I see for the future of WG21.

I also know there have been statements circulating in the committee that
have been attributed to me. They are not accurate and do not represent my
views. To understand my position, please read on or contact me directly.
I will devote as much time as needed this week to speak with members
before the SC22 vote.

** Why Convener?

Most of you know me from steady participation in the committee since 2018. Many
might not know that my passion for C++ goes back 30 years to a project in the
mid 90's. And that my first committee participation was during the C++11 era where
boost.date_time served as the original basis for C++11 chrono.

In the year 2000 after finishing my first industrial C++ project with 5 date-time
libraries, I wondered why it ended up that way. It was clearly a failure of
design -- mostly object oriented. So I experimented with my own ideas for date-time
using generic concepts. The separation of concerns generic programming offered had
me hooked. Since then I've not been able to let go of the expressiveness C++ allows
while creating fast and efficient programs.

As a result, I've spent an unreasonable amount of my spare time working toward
improving C++ via the committee, expanding the community via C++Now,
as part of the Boost Foundation leadership, and being an advocate and
communicator for C++ at conferences and in industry. The majority of the
effort is boring, unglamorous work that few will see and some will openly deride.

Similarly, most of Convener role comes with many non-technical and administrative
tasks. After all, the Convener doesn't make the standard, that's the job of the
committee. The Convenerâ€™s role is to set the conditions for committee work and
interact with the broader community. Inside WG21, that means building consensus,
improving processes, and organizing work for maximum effectiveness. Outside, it
means serving as a clear public voice for C++, supporting open-source engagement,
and liaising with other groups.

** Experience and Qualifications

This year I'm celebrating(?) my 40th year in software development. I've
been a team lead for decades on many large projects.  To me, being a leader
means that I work for my team - clearing obstacles, clarifying requirements,
removing politics, and generally improving the environment for them to do work.
I would bring this same approach to the Convener role - I work for the committee
not the other way around.

As part of WG21 I've written papers, reviewed and helped many authors
improve their work, and served as a subgroup co-chair in Library Working Group
since 2020.  In LWG I've been primarily responsible for scheduling and
also running the room in face-to-face meetings when Jonathan is absent.
My experiences as a chair informs my understanding of the challenges for
chairs.  It's a difficult and largely thankless job that is also critical
to the functioning and effectiveness of the overall committee.

During my time as co-chair in LWG we've faced the challenge of adapting to
remote work in the pandemic and now hybrid.  We've experimented with our
approaches abandoning things that don't work and sticking with those that do.
As a result of these tactical changes the years-long backlog in library
is gone.

I'm not trying to take sole credit for innovation in LWG - that belongs to
relentless effort of the entire team. Rather pointing out that process does
matter and that we should not be afraid to innovate.  In fact I think it's
essential to keep improving.  WG21 is a big committee and being a chair opens
your eyes to the struggles of our authors.  We would be wise to understand and
address the reasons that authors walk away from good proposals in frustration.
You might be surprised to learn there's one author that's been working for over
a decade on a small-medium sized paper that is still not adopted or rejected.
Really this isn't acceptable.

Going back to experience, the Convener is responsible for handling the guest
process and helping new meeting attendees. As part of the Boost Foundation
standardization initiative, I'm quite familiar with these processes and helping
new members navigate the committee. Currently we have some excellent components
like the Sunday meet. I'm certain we can do even more to make the committee
welcoming to new people.

** The Future of C++

As Herb said in the last plenary, C++26 is a breakthrough release: reflection,
contracts, senders-receivers, simd, and parallel range algorithms provide a
foundation for next generation of applications.

On their own, however, I fear these features are not enough to secure the future.
The perception of C++ as an unsafe language that's too difficult to use is a dark
cloud on the horizon that must be addressed to the best of our abilities. I believe
we face nothing less than a steep decline in users, vendors, and applications if we fail.

C++26 provides a start with erroneous behavior becoming defined and the hardened standard
library.  Some of what's needed is better communication about what we're already doing and
how to effectively utilize existing tools.

Still, many gaps remain. I'm well aware that the Convener doesn't dictate
the focus of an all-volunteer organization.  But, the Convener can
help organize development of a vision paper voted on by the entire committee that
informs subgroup priorities and encourage members to bring significant proposals
to the committee.

At this point, I'd like to clear up a specific confusion I've heard from committee members
about how I would approach being Convener.  Some have suggested that I would somehow
inject myself in key technical discussions and, in effect, exercise undue influence.
Even if I wanted to do that -- and I do not -- the committee would rightly push back.
A top-down strategy would last about as long as a snowball in a Phoenix summer.

** Actions I Plan to Take - Listening

My first act as Convener will be to meet with all the chairs and listen - one on one and
as a group.  In my view, chairs need to talk more and discuss best practices.
For the one on one, I want to hear first hand their frustrations and issues as well as ideas
for improvement.  I've already been meeting with chairs and other committee members, and can say
there is a deep well of excellent ideas to improve how we do business.

Some suggestions, like better scheduling for meetings, we can improve with small effort by chairs
working as a team. Things like scheduling seem trivial, but in a world with hybrid meetings
managing time zones for remote participants and conflicts for contributors is tricky and vital.
Doing this well improves the experience for all and the final product as well.

As part of the chair discussions, I'll be explicitly asking about growth of new
co-chairs. We need to identify and nurture future leadership so as members move
on from the committee we're prepared for continuity. Like we've done in LWG, some
co-chairs might mostly focus on a purposeful role such as scheduling or
results tracking -- so that the entire burden doesn't fall on a single person.

Other changes will require committee discussion and concurrence. Also, since the Convener
serves the entire committee I'll also open the door to conversations with any member. No
matter what, any changes we decide to make as a group will be transparent and clearly
communicated.

** Actions I Plan to Take - Vision and Early Consensus

I mentioned in an earlier section above a vision paper voted on by the committee. In
my experience, having a roadmap of priorities is essential to allocating time well.
I believe it will be worth the time and effort of the committee to come to consensus
on this so that as we work through a new standard we allocate time appropriately.  This
may mean that some proposals will be slowed in deference to higher priority items.

Of course that prioritization is already happening.  It's just being managed by subgroup
chairs without input from full committee discussion. To be clear, I'm not suggesting the
current chairs haven't made good decisions -- just that the committee as a whole didn't
have direct input on the priorities.

The priorities should be a living document open to ongoing revision. Three years is
a long time in our world and priorities can shift mid-cycle.  As for whom will author
and maintain this paper, this is a detail we would work out.  It could be the
output of a subgroup or just individual volunteer authors -- with contributions
from any member.

To do what I'm suggesting will require us to use some of the 360 hours of non-voting
face-to-face time we have in each cycle for either extended plenary or larger joint
sessions to discuss. Could we spare a couple hours over several meetings to have
larger group discussion as well as gaining early consensus on the design of key
features? I believe we could subtract a handful of hours from parallel subgroup
work to be proactive on this point. In the Sofia plenary we spent at least
thirty minutes discussing this point after some members where suprised.

I also think, perhaps counterintuitively, that at times we can be more efficient
by having some larger technical sessions -- so we avoid rehashing arguments in
multiple subgroups with different sets of people. Not only is this discouraging
and disorienting for authors, but it isn't an efficient use of time.  The decisions
about when to do this are best left to subgroup chairs with support from the
Convener.  Clearly this can't be done for everything, but especially for features
that span both language and library it is helpful to be working from the
same page.

** Actions I Plan to Take - Other Things

If you've not fallen asleep by this point, I hope it's clear that there is
no agenda to fire chairs, disband subgroups, require all library changes
to be part of the Beman project, and spend most of the committee
time on Rust -- all of which have apparently been incorrectly attributed
to me.

Rather, the agenda is to take time to reflect (pun intended) on how the standard
is made, document it better, and use the best ideas from the entire committee to
update our processes to make our work even more efficient and of the highest quality
possible. The users of C++ deserve nothing less from us.

** Closing

Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Herb for so many years
of service as Convener. He has carried out what is often a thankless role with
grace and efficiency that will be difficult to match.

As Convener I will work side by side with the rest of you to help us focus
on securing the future.  I'm confident that WG21 has the thought leaders to
close the gaps and put C++ on course to thrive for another 40 years.
In the end for me, there can be no higher service, responsibility, and
joy than helping to improve C++ for our millions of users.

Thank you for your time.

Jeff
